This will hold the answers to the Interview Questions



*  What are ports and their numbers like DNS, FTP, and DHCP?

DNS - Domain Name Server , Port 53
File Transport Protocol - (This sends and recieves info so has 2 ports for TCP); Port 20 and 21
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - (Also has a handshake in information sharing and has 2 ports); Port 67 and 68


*  What is the OSI model layers and what were their functions?

OSI model stands for Open System Interconnection and has 7 layers.

Layer 7: (The application layer.) Network Process to Application/End User Interface
Layer 6: (The presentation layer.) Data Representation and Encryption
Layer 5: (The session layer.) Interhost Communication, Email, Error correction
Layer 4: (The transport layer.) TCP, UDP, Disassembles and sends Packets
Layer 3: (The network layer.) IP addressing, Routers,
Layer 2: (The data-link layer.) MAC addressing, Network Cards, Switches,
Layer 1: (The physical layer.) Ethernet Cables


*  What is a DNS?

DNS Stands for Domain Name Server is a server that your computer sends a request to find an IP address to match a domain name request.
In order to find the IP address the computer first goes to the Resolving Name Server/DNS Recursor of the computer's Operating System.
If the DNS cannot find the IP address at the RNS, it will go to 1 of 13 Root Servers.
IF the Root Servers cannot find the IP address, it will go to the Top Level Domain Servers(TLD) and 
looks for the IP address and the .com,.org,.net portion of host name.
If it still cannot be found in the TLD, 
it will go to Authoritative Name Servers(which is updated whenever someone buys or sells a domain).
Once it is found on the ANS, it will send it back to the RNS, 
and then to the requesting computer and then save the IP address either with cache or on the RNS.

*  What Linux command you would use to limit administration access?

chmod

*  What is ransomeware?

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that threatens to publish the victim's data or 
perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid.
Often asking for cryptocurrency for payment.

*  Explain WannaCry

The WannaCry ransomware attack was a May 2017 worldwide cyberattack by the WannaCry ransomware cryptoworm.
It targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting data 
and demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin cryptocurrenucy.
It found a weakness in a Windows 10 OS, and the ransomeware was stopped by 
finding the domain site of the attacker that wasnt registered and buying the registration rights.

*  How do you find out latest exploits and news in the industry?

Through social media, news outlets, and cybersecurity communities like OWASP

*  Which 3 part handshake protocol is used to establish a connection?

TCP handshake

*  What is Http and Https?

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure 

*  Name the IP address ranges for the different classes and what their subnets masks were

(Class A addresses 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 cannot be used and is reserved for loopback and diagnostic functions.)

Class A | 1.0.0.0   - 127.255.255.255  | Subnet mask | 255.0.0.0     | CIDR | /8  | Hosts available | 16,777,214 | For Internetwork communication
Class B | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255  | Subnet mask | 255.255.0.0   | CIDR | /16 | Hosts available | 65,533     | For Internetwork communication
Class C | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255  | Subnet mask | 255.255.255.0 | CIDR | /24 | Hosts available | 254        | For Internetwork communication
Class D | 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255  | Subnet mask | -             | CIDR | /25 | Hosts available | 126        | Reserved for Multicasting
Class E | 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255  | Subnet mask | -             | CIDR | /26 | Hosts available | 62         | Reserved for research and experiments


*  Name the private IP addresses, their subnet masks, and their CIDR

Class A | 10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255  | Subnet mask | 255.0.0.0     | CIDR |  /8  |  Hosts available | 16777216 |
Class B | 172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255  | Subnet mask | 255.255.0.0   | CIDR |  /12 |  Hosts available | 1048576  |
Class C | 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 | Subnet mask | 255.255.255.0 | CIDR |  /16 |  Hosts available | 65636    |


*  Which handshake connection is used to prevent or show errors occurring in the network?

TCP Handshake

*  What is CIDR?

CIDR means Classless Inter-Domain Routing  and uses the Internet Protocol to create unique idrentifiers for networks and devices.
It creates these identifiers using a number of octates of bits for subnets. (Look into "Subnetting from CIDR" and how the bits work) 

*  What is DHCP?

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, it can be its own server but Routers often have a DHCP built in.
DHCP assigns individual private IP addresses to computers assigned to a network and 
will convert the private ip addresses to public addresses to the internet.
Then the DHCP will turn the public IP back into private ip addresses when returning the information to 
the router and back to the individual computer that requested the information.

*  Which security method helps block and prevent ports from being accessed?

Firewall

*  What prevents a network from intrusion?

IPS

*  What is an injection attack?
Injection attacks refer to attacks that allow an attacker to supply untrusted input to a program, 
which gets processed by an interpreter as part of a command or query.
This alters the course of execution of that program.

Different types of injection attacks are:
-Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
-Code injection
-CRLF injection
-Email (Mail command/SMTP) injection
-Host header injection
-SQL injection (SQLi)
-XPath injection

*  How do you read Wireshark and a IDS/IPS scan paper for intrusion scans and how/why the intrusion occured
